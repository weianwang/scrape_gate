# The Gate Web Scraper

Author: Weian Wang

Work in progress. 
Lacks portability, but suffices to collect data for The Gate project with Data Analysts for Social Good at UChicago. 
The Gate is a publication at the University of Chicago (uchicagogate.com).
Data included is relevant as of May 2014. 

## Contains: 
* Definitions.py
This defines the sections of the website to scrape from.
* Spider.py
This is the actual scraper that extracts the data and writes to .csv file in specific format. 

## Additions and Future Plans:
I plan to integrate Google Analytics data for purpose of data analysis.
