# The Gate Web Scraper

Author: Weian Wang

Work in progress. 
Lacks portability, but suffices to collect data for The Gate project with Data Analysts for Social Good at UChicago. 
The Gate is a publication at the University of Chicago (uchicagogate.com).
Data included is relevant as of May 31, 0214.

## Contains: 
* Definitions.py
This defines the sections of the website to scrape from.
* Spider.py
This is the actual scraper that extracts the data and writes to .csv file in specific format. 
* extract_articles.py
This extracts the data for Gate articles from the Google Analytics Page Data from April 20 to May 20, 2014 and February 1st to May 31st, 2014. Also, uses quicksort to sort the articles by date in increasing order.
* articles_sort_date.py
Uses quicksort algorithm to sort the Gate articles in gate_articles.csv
* collate.py
Collates data from gates_articles_datesort.csv and the filtered google page data ([filtered]google_pagedata_420-520.csv).

## Additions and Future Plans:
None so far. Not exactly ideal in terms of portability but it got the job done.

## How to Use:
Generally, to read a CSV file, you can use Excel, go to Data tab on the header ribbon, go to Get External Data, click From Text. Open the CSV file, then set the Delimiter to 'Comma'.
